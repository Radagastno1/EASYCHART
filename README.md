## EASY CHART

run project: npm run dev
change the cakeslices in IndexPage.tsx to test it

The goal is to make this (soon to be) chart-renderer very user friendly and simple
The user should be able to add colors and cakeslices and more info in an easy way to see their chart circle

I would love to get input and help :)
